#Tutorial 3: Introduction to Vehicle Modification

The penultimate tutorial will go over how to modify the vehicle setup. We will cover some organization guidelines and the modifications to the original vehicle setup using the output parameters tool. You can either follow along with the parameters being used in this file or you can use your own parameters.  We will once again be modelling things using a late model GT car. This tutorial requires the setup created in the previous tutorial. If you do not have the files, they can be downloaded from [here](../Tutorial Baseline.ODVeh)

Here is the order we will follow in our tutorial:

1) [Organizing vehicle setup](2_VehicleOrg.md)

2) [Changing vehicle parameter](3_SetupChange.md)

3) [Running new simulations](4_NewSim.md)

4) [Organzing results](5_ResultsOrg.md)

5) [Creating Comparison Plot](6_CompPlot.md)

6) [Exporting setup changes](7_ExportChange.md)
