#Organizing Vehicle Setups

At this time, there should be only two setups in the __Vehicle Setup__ library if following along through all the tutorials or one vehicle setup in the __Vehicle Setup__ library if you are starting from this point.  There should also be an acceleration file for the Nurburgring GP circuit in the __Acceleration__ library.

We are going to create a second copy of the baseline setup that we will use for modification. We are also going to create a folder for the modified setup. Here are the steps that we will follow in doing so:

![Setup Folder](../img/new_setup_folder.png)

1) Right click on the __Vehicle Setup__ library. Select the __Create->New Folder__ option as shown above

![Folder Name](../img/setup_folder_name.png)

2) Provide a name for the folder. We are going to call the folder __Front Setup Changes__ as shown above.

![Copy Setup](../img/copy_setup.png)

3) We will now copy the baseline setup.  Right click on the setup and select __Copy__.

![Paste Setup](../img/paste_setup.png)

4) Select the created folder and __Right Click->Paste__. __Rename__ the copied setup 

![Modified Setup](../img/modified_setup.png)

5) Make sure that the baseline setup is closed, then __Open__ the copied vehicle setup.

![Setup Comments](../img/comments_section.png)

6) We will use the __comment__ tool along the bottom of the __Document Manager__ to explain what is being done with this setup.  Copy down the comments shown above. We will make the setup changes in the next step.
