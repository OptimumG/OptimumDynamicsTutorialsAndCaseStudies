#Exporting and Saving Setup Changes

While we have made the setup changes in OptimumDynamics, the components modified have __Not__ been stored in the __Component Library__. We have a few different options available to create components from the modified setup.

We will start by exporting directly from the setup user interface in the __Document Manager__. To do so:

1) __Right Click__ on the simulation input that is going to be exported.

![Rename Component](../img/rename_component.png)

2) Select __Rename__ to rename the modified component so that the library has both options.

![Export Tool](../img/export_file.png)

3) __Right Click__ again then select __Export to Library__ option as shown above

4) __Repeat__ this step for the __Rear Coilover__, the __Rear Spring__, and the __Front Spring__.

![New Components](../img/new_components.png)

5) We can now go to the __Design__ tab and see the components that we exported.
