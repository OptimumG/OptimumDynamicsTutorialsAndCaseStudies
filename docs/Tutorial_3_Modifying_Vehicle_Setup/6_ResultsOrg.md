#Organizing the Simulation Results

At this point, there are a significant number of simulation results that have been created in the __Analysis__ tool. We are now going to organinze the results.

Here is the process we are going to take:

1) Check that you have all of the simulations from this tutorial and the the previous tutorial (if using the same file). There should be 15 simulation results created in the __Results__ folder if every simulation has been run.

![Results folder](../img/results_folder.png)

2) Create __three__ folders for the __Results__ library. __Right Click__ on the __Results__ library and select __Create->New Folder__.

![New Folders](../img/new_folders.png)

3) The three new folders should be as shown above. We are going to organize our results by the type of input used

4) Left Click on a Simulation result and drag the simulation result to the corresponding simulation. A black bar will show up below the folder where the result will be moved to.

5) Create one more folder within the __Track Replay__ folder to organize the __Batch Simulation__ results and the rest of the simulations. Use the same steps so that the folders look like the above image.

![Color Organization](../img/color_org.png)

You will notice that we also have the colors available to work with on the left hand side in the __Project Tree__. We are also going to use those to organize things.

Here is how we are going to use the colors:

1) We will use a common color range for the three input folders.  Use __blue__ for the forces, __red__ for the acceleration, and __green__ for the track replays.

2) __Gradient__ each of the colors for the simulations. Once we have everything organized, we can __save__ the project
