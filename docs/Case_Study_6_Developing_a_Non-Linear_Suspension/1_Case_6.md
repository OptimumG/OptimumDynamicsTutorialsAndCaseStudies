Recreate a non-linear suspension by measuring the components of a vehicle.

Literally probably just going to measure this off whatever the hell I can find in a junkyard that has an independent rear (likely pre 2000)

1) Set coordinate system

2) measure the coordinates of the reference point

Go into rules advantages??

Explain how to use the non-linear options of OptimumDynamics

Discuss how to measure off an image? (a bit unsporting but would explain how to approximate a competitors vehicle and compare to your own)
