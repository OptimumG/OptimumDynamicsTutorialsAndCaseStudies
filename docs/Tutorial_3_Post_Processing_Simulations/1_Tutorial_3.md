#Introduction

This tutorial will show how to start post processing the data provided by the simulations created in the previous tutorial. We will show how to create a workspace in order to organize and understand what the vehicle is doing.  You may either follow along with the parameters we are inputting or you can use your own data. The simulation results for this tutorial can also be downloaded [here](../Tutorial_Files.zip)
