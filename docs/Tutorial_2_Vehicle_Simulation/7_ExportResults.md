#Exporting Simulation Results

Results files are automatically generated by the software and will appear after a simulation has been run. The files can then be exported to either another OptimumDynamics file, a CSV file, or an Excel file. The results can then have post processing completed in other file formats.

To export the results file as a CSV format:

![Export Data](../img/export_data.png)

1) Right click on the data file that is desired to be exported, go to __Export->CSV File__

2) The file location can then be specified and the data used in any other file format. The process can be used for any other file format.

__Note:__ OptimumDynamics can only import an OptimumDynamics Native File
