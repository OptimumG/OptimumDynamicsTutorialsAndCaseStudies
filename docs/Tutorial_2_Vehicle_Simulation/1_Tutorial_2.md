#Tutorial 2: Introduction to Vehicle Simulation

This tutorial will cover information on how to create a vehicle simulation using the vehicle created in the first tutorial. If you do not have the model used in the first tutorial, it can be downloaded [here](../Tutorial Baseline.ODVeh) The vehicle we are using for our simulations is a later model GT car.  You may choose to follow along with the parameters we are putting in, or if you have your own data available, you can use this as a guide to the workflow and conventions of OptimumDynamics.

Here is the order in which we will go through the components:


1) [Importing and Exporting a Setup](2_ImportExport.md)

2) [Creating a Single Force Simulation](3_SingleStepSim.md)

3) [Creating a Smooth Multiple Step Simulation](4_MultiStepSim.md)

4) [Creating a Freehand Multiple Step Simulation](5_MultiStepRough.md)

5) [Making a Track Replay Simulation](6_TrackReplay.md)

6) [Exporting Results Files](7_ExportResults.md)

7) [Creating a Yaw Moment Diagram](8_YMDSim.md)

8) [Conclusion](9_Conclusions.md)
