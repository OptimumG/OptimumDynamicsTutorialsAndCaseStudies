#Gearbox

The last component to set parameters for is the gearbox.  This sets the torque ratio that is applied to the rear wheels for a given instance in the simulation.

To set the gear ratios:

![New Gearbox](../img/new_gearbox.png)

1) Click on the __Gearbox__ button and choose the __New Constant Reduction Gearbox__ option.

![Gearbox Name](../img/gearbox_name.png)

2) Set the name for the gearbox and click __OK__

![Gearbox Params](../img/gearbox_param.png)

3) Set the final drive and each of the ratios as follow above.

Everything should now be all set to create the setup. Check now for any missing components
