#Differential

The differential is used to distribute the torque between the left and right wheels.  The differential we will be using for our tutorial is a limited-slip salisbury differential.  To create the differential:

![New Diff](../img/new_diff.png)

1) Select the __Differential__ button and choose the __New Differential__ option.

![Diff Name](../img/diff_name.png)

2) Set a name for the differential as above, and click __OK__

3) Choose the __Salisbury__ option under __Type__

![Salisbury Param](../img/diff_param.png)

4) Set the parameters for the ramp coefficient, coast coefficient, preload, and viscous coefficient as found above.
