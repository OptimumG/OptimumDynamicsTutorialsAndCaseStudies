#Introduction to Vehicle Setup

Vehicle setup is the way in which OptimumDynamics determines what components are being used in a simulation.  While the initial setup is referenced to the components within the design library, they are NOT quantitatively tied to the original components. Meaning that a change in the setup window will not change the part in the design section and vise-versa.

Any number of vehicle setups can be used to compare vehicle design and competition. The next page goes through how to add components to a setup.
