#Case Studies

Case studies have been set up to help exhibit the capabilities of OptimumDynamics and provide insight into how to analyze your vehicle.  Below are the Case Studies available


#__[Case Study 1: Creating a Database](Case_Study_1_Create_a_Database/1_Case_1.md)__

In this case study we show how to create a database of components and compare the effects each component will have on the vehicle using a batch simulation

#__[Case Study 2: Track Study](Case_Study_2_Track_Study/1_Case_2.md)__

In this case study, we show how to make setup changes based on how the vehicle behaved using the track analysis tool.

#__[Case Study 3: Validating a Vehicle in Simulation](Case_Study_3_Validate_Vehicle/1_Case_3.md)__

This case study shows how to compare real world data to the simulation data to validate that the model correlates to the actual behavior

#__[Case Study 4: Investigating Vehicle Balance](Case_Study_4_Vehicle_Balance/1_Case_4.md)__

In this case study, we look at the behavior of a vehicle in a given simulation and show how to make adjustments to improve net vehicle behavior

#__[Case Study 5: Investigating Aerodynamic Balance](Case_Study_5_Aero_Balance/1_Case_5.md)__

Using a library of aerodynamic components, this case study explains how to get the most out of an aerodynamic system by using a two parameter study.

#__[Case Study 6: Developing a Non-Linear Suspension](Case_Study_6_Developing_a_Non-Linear_Suspension/1_Case_6.md)__

This case study goes over how to create, analyze, and utilize the non-linear suspension function in OptimumDynamics to understand how to improve the vehicle reactions. We also go over tips and tricks in diagnosing errors in a vehicle simulation

#__[Case Study 7: Benchmarking a Vehicle Design](Case_Study_7_Vehicle_Benchmark/1_Case_7.md)__

In this case study, we create a second competitor vehicle and show how to compare two vehicles using a series of standardized simulations and plots.

#__[Case Study 8: Creating Course Inputs](Case_Study_8_Creating_Course_Inputs/1_Case_8.md)__

This case study goes over how to approximate a vehicle course using data provided by the developer and reference information from competior vehicles.
