#Create a Contour Plot

The contour plot is a featured plot within OptimumDynamics that can be used to compare two different parameters and see the net effect they have on a result. The contour plot is often created based off the output data from a __Two-Parameter Study__. Unlike the other plots, a contour plot cannot be put into a worksheet.

To create a contour plot:

![New Contour](../img/new_contour.png)

1) Click on the __Contour__ button located along the __Command Ribbon__

![Contour Name](../img/contour_name.png)

2) Provide a name for the contour plot

![Contour Editor](../img/contour_editor.png)

3) The __Contour Plot Editor__ now comes up. We now have options to set the __Horizontal Axis__ the __Vertical Axis__ and the __Gradient Series__.

4) Set the __Horizontal Axis__ to be the Front Downforce of the vehicle

5) Set the __Vertical Axis__ to be the Front Anti-Roll Bar Stiffness

6) Set the __Gradient Color__ to be the Lateral Load Transfer Distribution of the Vehicle

7) Set the __Results Series__ to be the Two Parameter Study in the Results Table.

8) Click __OK__. The plot should look comparable to the one listed above
