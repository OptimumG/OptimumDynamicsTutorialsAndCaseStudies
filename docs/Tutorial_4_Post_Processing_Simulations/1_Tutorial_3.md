#Tutorial 4: Introduction to Simulation Post Processing

The last tutorial will show how to start post processing the data provided by the simulations created in the previous tutorial. We will show how to create a workspace in order to organize and allow you to focus on understanding what the vehicle is doing.  You may either follow along with the parameters we are inputting or you can use your own data. The simulation results that are used for this tutorial can also be downloaded __[here](../Tutorial_Files.zip)__. If you have been following along from the beginning, you do not need to download anything

The workflow for this tutorial will be as follows:

__1) [Importing results](2_Importing_Results.md)__

__2) [Create Worksheet](3_Create_Worksheet.md)__

__3) [Create Table](4_CreateTable.md)__

__4) [Creating 2D Charts](5_2DChart.md)__

__5) [Creating Contour Plot](6_ContourChart.md)__

__6) [Creating a Comparison Plot](7_CompPlot.md)__

__7) [Creating YMD Plot](8_YMDPlot.md)__

__8) [Creating Track Map](9_TrackMap.md)__

__9) [Reporting Simulation Results](10_SimReport.md)__

__10) [Creating Math Channels](11_MathChan.md)__

__11) [Conclusions](12_Conclusion.md)__
