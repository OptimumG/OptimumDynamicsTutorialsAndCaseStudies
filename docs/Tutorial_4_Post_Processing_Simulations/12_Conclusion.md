#Conclusions

Congratgulations, you have now finished the tutorials for OptimumDynamics! You should now have everything you need to create your own vehicle, start creating new simulations, analyze vehicle changes and report the outputs from the simulations. In this last section, we learned:

1) How to Import Vehicle Simulation Results

2) How to create and use a worksheet to stay organized

3) How to create a table and compare output results

4) How to create a 2D chart

5) How to add and change series within a 2D Chart

6) How to create a contour chart

7) How to read a contour chart

8) How to create a yaw moment diagram plot

9) How to create a track map analysis plop

10) How to export results and prepare simulation results for a report

If you would like more practice with OptimumDynamics or would like more information on how to get the most out of the software, we encourage you to check out our __[Case Studies](../Case_Studies.md)__. Otherwise, good luck and find that Unfair Advantage!
